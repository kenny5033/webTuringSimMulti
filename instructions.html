        <p>
            <span>All code must begin on the first line with "ATM" to specify that it is A Turing Machine
                code.</span><br>
            <span>Addtionally all code must end with "END" to specify the end.</span><br>
            <span>Comments may be made as the final part of any line, but may not be on a line by themselves.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>After the first line ("ATM") begins the configuration section, which is written as follows:</span><br>
            <span>Line 2) The name of the machine (if downloaded, the file will have this name as well)</span><br>
            <span class="parent">Line 3) The input alphabet, where each valid character is seperated from its nieghbor
                by a space.</span><br>
            <span class="tabbed"> Example) "0 1" would be line 3 for a machine accepting bitstrings as input.</span><br>
            <span class="parent">Line 4) The tape alphabet, where each valid character is seperated from its nieghbor by
                a space.</span><br>
            <span class="tabbed parent">--Note-- To include the blank character in the tape alphabet, use
                'B'.</span><br>
            <span class="tabbed"> Exmaple) "0 1 B" would be line 4 for a machine able to read and write bitstrings and
                the blank character.</span><br>
            <span>Line 5) The number of tapes (n)</span><br>
            <span>Line(s) 6 through 5 + n) The number of tracks for tape n. The number of tracks needs to be specified
                for every tape.</span><br>
            <span>Line(s) 5 + n + 1 through 5 + 2n) The infinite directions (1 or 2 way) for tape n. The infinite
                directions needs to be specified for every tape.</span><br>
            <span>Line 5 + 2n + 1) The initial state of the machine, i.e. the state the machine will begin at when the
                run starts.</span><br>
            <span>Line 5 + 2n + 2) The accepting/final states of the machine.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Line 5 + 2n + 3 begins the transition function section.</span><br>
            <span>There can be any number of transition functions greater than or equal to 0.</span><br>
            <span>Transition functions are written in the form "[state to be in for this function to be called]
                [character(s) to read for this function to be called] [new state into which transition] [new
                character(s) to write] [direction(s) to move tape head(s)]"</span><br>
            <span>[character(s) to read for this function to be called] and [new character(s) to write] <b>need</b> to
                be
                characters of the tape alphabet</span><br>
            <span>[direction(s) to move tape head] needs to be either "R" for right, "L" for left, or "S" for
                stationary.</span>
            <span>Be careful in writing a transition function with the same [state to be in for this function to be
                called] and [character(s) to read for this function to be called] as another transition function. The
                newer tranision fucntion will overwrite the previous.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>There should be but one overly-complex line following the transition function section. "END" (or
                "end"). </span>

        <p class="sectionHeader">Running the Machine</p>
        <p>
            <span>To run the Turing Machine, enter any string of characters from the input alphabet into the text area
                labled "Input" (read about multiple input areas in the "Multitracking and Multitaping" section) and then
                press the "Run" button. Additionally, the "Step" button can be used to have the machine move forward by
                a single step.</span><br>
            <span>Upon pressing the "Run" button, it will convert to the "Pause" button, which will pause the machine
                and allow for stepping. The machine can pick off from its current step at any time by pressing the "Run"
                button again.</span><br>
            <span>The speed at which the machine runs can be controlled by the slider labed "Speed".</span><br>
            <span>The machine may be reset after halting by pressing the "Reset" button, which will reset all tapes and
                tracks to their defaults.</span><br>
            <span>Additionally, the machine may be reset with the curent output by pressing the "Rerun With Current
                Output" button, which will only reset the current state to the start state and bring all tracks back to
                their first cell.</span><br>
            <span>The output for all tracks may be copied to the clipboard by pressing the "Copy Output" button. The
                information will be in the form "tape0.track0: [output for tape 0's track 0]" on seperate lines for
                every track on each tape.</span><br>
            <span>Below the reset and copy buttons is the current state and recognized status of the input.</span><br>
            <span>The current state of the machine will be displayed and updated when the machine's state
                updates.</span><br>
            <span>When the machine halts, it will display the recognized status of the input.</span>

                tracks configuration is Line 6)</span><br>
            <span>To utilize multitaping, change the number of tapes (Line 5)</span><br>
            <span><b>For every tape</b>, there needs to be a line to configure the number of tracks and the infinite
                directions. (See more about this in the "Programming the Machine" section)</span>
            <span class="parent">The reading and writing instructions for every transition function <b>need to be

                read/written
                on the last track (top to bottom).</span><br>

            <span class="tabbed">Note that an explicitly defined transition function will be choosen over a wildcard
                transition function. That is, given a machine in state "s0" reading "0", the transition function "s0 0
                s1 1 R" <b>will have priority</b> over "s0 * s1 1 R".</span><br>
            <span class="parent">A wildcard character can be used in the [new character(s) to write] section to stand
                for the character currently in the cell at which the tape head points.</span><br>
            <span class="tabbed">For example, given the transition fucntion "s0 0 s1 <b>*</b> R", a machine in
                state "s0" reading "0" will leave that 0 being read and move right.</span><br>
