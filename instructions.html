        <p>
            <span>All code must begin on the first line with "ATM" to specify that it is A Turing Machine
                code.</span><br>
            <span>Addtionally all code must end with "END" to specify the end.</span><br>
            <span>Comments may be made as the final part of any line, but may not be on a line by themselves.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>After the first line ("ATM") begins the configuration section, which is written as follows:</span><br>
            <span>Line 2) The name of the machine (if downloaded, the file will have this name as well)</span><br>
            <span class="parent">Line 3) The input alphabet, where each valid character is seperated from its nieghbor
                by a space.</span><br>
            <span class="tabbed"> Example) "0 1" would be line 3 for a machine accepting bitstrings as input.</span><br>
            <span class="parent">Line 4) The tape alphabet, where each valid character is seperated from its nieghbor by
                a space.</span><br>
            <span class="tabbed parent">--Note-- To include the blank character in the tape alphabet, use an underscore
                (_).</span><br>
            <span class="tabbed"> Exmaple) "0 1 _" would be line 4 for a machine able to read and write bitstrings and
                the blank character.</span><br>
            <span>Line 5) The number of tapes (n)</span><br>
            <span>Line(s) 6 through 5 + n) The number of tracks for tape n. The number of tracks needs to be specified
                for every tape.</span><br>
            <span>Line(s) 5 + n + 1 through 5 + 2n) The infinite directions (1 or 2 way) for tape n. The infinite
                directions needs to be specified for every tape.</span><br>
            <span>Line 5 + 2n + 1) The initial state of the machine, i.e. the state the machine will begin at when the
                run starts.</span><br>
            <span>Line 5 + 2n + 2) The accepting or final states of the machine.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Line 5 + 2n + 3 begins the transition function section.</span><br>
            <span>There can be any number of transition functions greater than or equal to 1.</span><br>
            <span>Transition functions are written in the form "[state to be in for this function to be called]
                [character to read for this function to be called] [new state into which transition] [new character to
                write] [direction to move tape head]"</span><br>
            <span>[character to read for this function to be called] and [new character to write] <b>need</b> to be
                characters of the tape alphabet</span><br>
            <span>[direction to move tape head] needs to be either "R" for right, "L" for left, or "S" for stationary.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>There should be but one overly-complex line following the transition function section. "END" (or "end"). </span>

                labled "Input" (read about multiple input areas in the "Multitracking and Multitaping" section) and then
                press the "Run" button.</span><br>
            <span>The speed at which the machine runs can be controlled by the slider labed "Speed".</span><br>
            <span>Additionally, the machine may be rerun with the curent output by pressing the "Rerun With Current
                Output" button.</span><br>
            <span>Below the rerun button is the current state and recognized status of the input.</span><br>
            <span>The current state of the machine will be displayed and updated when the machine's state
